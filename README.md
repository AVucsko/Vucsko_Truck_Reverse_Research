This repo includes src files included in my catkin_ws running a gazebo simulation for an articulated tractor-trailer. The original catkin_ws is running on ROS Noetic.

kinematic_trailer_animation is a standalone python file running a kinematic simulation. This is separate to ensure the controllers work in both environments.
